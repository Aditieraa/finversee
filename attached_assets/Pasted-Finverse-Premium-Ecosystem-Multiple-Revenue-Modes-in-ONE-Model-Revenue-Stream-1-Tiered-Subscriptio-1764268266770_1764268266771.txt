Impulse purchases → In-app boosters drive quick revenue
Passive income → Courses + affiliates = less work, more money
Scalable → All revenue streams scale with more users
Low competition → Few Indian financial games do this properly
Implementation Steps
Add subscription tiers to user profiles (database)
Create payment gateway integration with dummy data 
Add feature gates based on subscription tier
Create in-app store for boosters/cosmetics
Build courses section with content upload
Add affiliate tracking system
Create enterprise pricing page
include all this, also it should be visible after logging in in the bottom of the dashboard right below portfolio and health score  section, create its own component there integrate this in parts one by one using the fast mode agent,also do not change any of the existing web app complete 
now i want u toimplement following for the web app and it should be visible as a section create its separate tab, it is just dummy,and create dummy look and functionality for it
